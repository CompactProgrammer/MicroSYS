===== Driver Header =====
Byte    Size    Contains
0x00    2       Pointer to driver setup code
0x02    2       Relocatable segment (should be 0 in file, MicroSYS will set this)

===== Making Drivers Callable =====
In the setup code, the driver must set an interrupt vector to a function.
The best way to do this is to call MicroSYS function 0x01.
